# the base-language versions be gathered from the dependency table
# I can split the table into named sections and create a section for the
# base-language entries and then the version numbers
# can be harvested from that.

# TODO: add checks that the version numbers of
# the repo-name and the image-name match up.

# TODO: add check that the repo-names version
# numbers use -1.2.3 format.

# TODO: add check that the image-names for
# base images use version numbers use :1.2.3 format.

# TODO: add check that the image-names for
# language+test images do NOT use version numbers.
# Is this what I want?
# I could a version number here and then _also_
# tag the image as latest (and push that)
# (possibly with a command line option).
# Orthogonal to that, what version number do I use?
# The language's or the test framework's? Or both?
