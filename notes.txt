Plan
----
This repo that maintains a master list of dependency info.
Specifically,
o) the name of the language+TF repo
o) the name of the docker image it builds (needed?)
o) the name of the docker image they are built FROM


Verifying
---------
Each language+TF repo as part of its .travis.yml script
will check the correctness of its entry in this master
list by passing it the names of...
  o) the docker image it builds
     - which it reads directly from the manifest.json file
  o) the docker image it is built FROM
     - which it reads directly from the first line of
       its own Dockerfile)
  o) its own language+TF repo


Notifying
---------
Each language+TF repo, as part of its .travis.yml script
will then ask this repo for the names of all the other
language+TF repos it needs to notify (since they depend on
it and it has just changed and successfully built a new image
and pushed it to dockerhub).

NB: I can stick with the javascript based notification
I'm using although I should upgrade to using a POST which
the travis API v3 now allows. See
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds/
