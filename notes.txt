# TODO: are we are on Travis or running locally?
# If on Travis, then only the current dir needs to be
# volume mounted so it is visible inside the container.
# Dependent repos will be git clones.
# If locally, then I need to volume-mount the base-dir
# so that all dependent repos will be available inside
# the container without doing a git clone. I could of course
# still do git clones, but I want to be able to edit
# multiple repos in the chain locally.

# TODO: volume-mount the cyber-dojo script inside the
# container if running locally? (I run it to check a
# dir's start_point/ is valid).
# This would avoid needing to curl it.

# TODO: think I need to volume-mount the json file
# containing the dependency triples. Unless this is
# parameterizable the script won't be much use for
# someone testing out their own language/test repos.



# display version numbers
# - - - - - - - - - - - -
# the base-language versions be gathered from the dependency table
# I can split the table into named sections and create a section for the
# base-language entries and then the version numbers
# can be harvested from that.

# TODO: add checks that the version numbers of
# the repo-name and the image-name match up.

# TODO: add check that the repo-names version
# numbers use -1.2.3 format.

# TODO: add check that the image-names for
# base images use version numbers use :1.2.3 format.

# TODO: add check that the image-names for
# language+test images do NOT use version numbers.
# Is this what I want?
# I could a version number here and then _also_
# tag the image as latest (and push that)
# (possibly with a command line option).
# Orthogonal to that, what version number do I use?
# The language's or the test framework's? Or both?
